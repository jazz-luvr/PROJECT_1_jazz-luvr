<h1>we went to CLOWN CHURCH today !!!!</h1>
    
<p>As you lie in bed staring at the ceiling<br>
What does it mean when you sleep?<br>
Is it normal to sleep?<br>
I don’t…<br>
What is sleep?</p>
  
<p>Why does it sound like<br> 
there are bugs crawling<br> 
underneath your pillow<br> 
when your body stops breathing</p>

<p>It crawls up on top of your pillow<br>  
before you go to sleep every night<br> 
It clearly pointed out sleep<br> 
when your body stops breathing</p>

<p>without observing you<br> 
it can't fall asleep <br> 
proper positioning is key<br>  
airflow,<br>  
but absolutely no light.<br>  
when your body stops breathing</p>

<p>... Exactly.</p>

<p>It curls up around your head and licks your forehead<br>  
scrunched into the headboard<br>  
and half on your head,<br>  
banging and humming<br> 
banging its head into your pillow and humming<br> 
when your body stops breathing<br>  
You wake up</p>

<p>When you wake up you see your pillow on the ground.</p>

<p>... Exactly.</p>
